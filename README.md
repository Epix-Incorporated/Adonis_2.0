Adonis is a community-maintained server moderation and management system created for use on the Roblox platform.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTICE

This version of Adonis is a **WORK IN PROGRESS** and is missing many features. For the current and supported version, see the [Adonis 1.0 repository](https://github.com/Epix-Incorporated/Adonis).

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT USE ADONIS 2.0 IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT! IT WILL NOT WORK.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**The following information on this page may not be accurate.**

## ‚ú® Installation {#installation}

(WIP)

If you get stuck, feel free to ask for assistance in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/H5RvTP3).

### Method 1 (recommended): Official Roblox Model {#method-1}

1. [Take a copy](https://www.roblox.com/library/7510622625/) of the Adonis loader model from the Roblox library
2. Insert the model into Studio using the Toolbox into `ServerScriptService`

### Method 2: GitHub Releases {#method-2}

1. Download the `rbxm` file snapshot from the [latest release](https://github.com/Epix-Incorporated/Adonis_2.0/releases/latest)
2. Import the model file into Studio
  * Note: By default, snapshots included in releases have [`DebugMode`](#debug-mode) enabled.

### Method 3: Filesystem {#method-3}

1. Download the repository to your computer's file system
2. Install and use a plugin like [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) to compile Adonis into a `rbxmx` file
  * If using Rojo, you can run `rojo build /path/to/adonis -o Adonis.rbxmx` to build a `rbxmx`
3. Import the compiled model file into Studio
  * Note: By default, loaders compiled from the repository have [`DebugMode`](#debug-mode) enabled. **This method compiles the *bleeding edge* version of Adonis, which may be unstable.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Debug Mode {#debug-mode}

The Adonis loader provides a `DebugMode` option which will load a local copy of the `MainModule` rather than fetching the latest version. This could be useful if you want to stay on a particular version of Adonis or want to maintain a custom version for your game. Debug mode expects the `MainModule` to share the same parent with the loader model (e.g. both should be in `ServerScriptService`). **By default, snapshots provided in  releases have `DebugMode` enabled.**

### Toggling debug mode {#toggling-debug-mode}

1. Open `Adonis_Loader` > `Loader` > `Loader`
2. Change `DebugMode` at the end of the `data` table to the desired value (e.g. `DebugMode = false`)
